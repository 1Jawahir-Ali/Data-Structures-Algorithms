This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** coursework and practice implementations. It is designed to build a strong foundation in both **linear** and **non-linear** data structures along with commonly used **sorting algorithms**.
The implementations focus on **clarity, logic building, and academic understanding**, making this repository useful for students, beginners, and anyone revising core DSA concepts.

## Course Objectives

* Understand fundamental **data structures** and their real-world use cases
* Learn how data is organized, stored, and accessed efficiently
* Analyze **time and space complexity** of algorithms
* Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Prepare a solid base for advanced topics like **OOP, databases, and system design**


## Topics Covered

#### Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures store elements sequentially.

* **Arrays**

  * One-dimensional and basic operations
  * Traversal, insertion, deletion

* **Structures / Records**

  * Grouping related data items
  * Use of structures for data modeling

* **Linked List**

  * Singly Linked List
  * Dynamic memory allocation
  * Insertion and deletion operations

* **Stack**

  * LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
  * Stack operations: push, pop, peek
  * Applications of stack

* **Queue**

  * FIFO (First In First Out) principle
  * Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue
  * Applications of queue

#### Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures do not store data sequentially and are used to represent hierarchical relationships.

* **Introduction to Non-Linear DSA**

  * Conceptual understanding of trees and graphs
  * Differences between linear and non-linear structures

*(More non-linear structures can be added in future updates.)*

## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending).

| Algorithm      | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)             |

#### Implemented Algorithms

* **Bubble Sort** – Comparison-based, beginner-friendly
* **Insertion Sort** – Efficient for small datasets
* **Selection Sort** – Simple logic, fixed comparisons
* **Merge Sort** – Divide & Conquer, efficient for large data
